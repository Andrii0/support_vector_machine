Usage:

-Run app.mlapp in MATLAB. Make sure all files are in the present working directory

-User can generate new data by pressing “Generate New Data” which will generate new training points randomly.

-While app is running user can input new training data by assigning array of points in console to “red” (class1) and “blue” (class2) where array is the form of: blue = [point1 point2 … pointN] 
where point is the form of: 
point1 = [x_cord ; y_cord]

-User can also input new data to be classified by assigning array of points in the same format as above to “data”

-User can change parameters “gamma”, ”a”, ”b” manually for all transformations by sliding drag bars and then clicking “Plot”. For linear transformation user can simply click “Optimize” and then “Plot” button and the program will find the best parameter.
